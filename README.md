What is JSX?
JSX stands for JavaScript XML.
JSX allows us to write HTML in React.
JSX makes it easier to write and add HTML in React.

Rules of JSX:-
    You can only return one top-level element from a given component. ...
    Some elements in HTML do not have a closing tag. ...
    A React component must be capitalized. ...
    To include JavaScript expressions in JSX, you need to wrap them in curly braces. ...
    The term “class” is a reserved keyword in JavaScript.

Components:-
    Components are independent and reusable bits of code. They serve the same purpose as JavaScript functions, but work in isolation and return HTML.
Components come in two types, Class components and Function components.

Webpack:-
Webpack is a popular module bundling system built on top of Node. js. It can handle not only combination and minification of JavaScript and CSS files, but also other assets such as image files (spriting) through the use of plugins.

What is Babel?
Babel is a JavaScript compiler
Babel is a toolchain that is mainly used to convert ECMAScript 2015+ code into a backwards compatible version of JavaScript in current and older browsers or environments. Here are the main things Babel can do for you:
Transform syntax
Polyfill features that are missing in your target environment (through a third-party polyfill such as core-js)
Source code transformations (codemods)
